In a Lifecycle Manager (like Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager for EBS snapshots and AMIs), both default and custom policies serve to automate the management of your data backups. However, they differ significantly in their scope, flexibility, and how they identify resources.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

**Default Policies**

* **Broad Scope:** Default policies are designed for broad coverage. They automatically target **all** applicable resources (e.g., all EBS volumes or EC2 instances) within a specified AWS Region, unless you explicitly define exclusion parameters.
* **Simplicity:** They offer a straightforward, "set it and forget it" approach for basic backup needs.
* **Limited Customization:** While you can set the creation frequency and retention period, and define some exclusions (like excluding boot volumes or specific volume types/tags), they generally lack the granular control of custom policies.
* **Automatic Resource Discovery:** They automatically discover and back up resources that meet their general criteria. You don't need to explicitly tag each resource for it to be included (unless you're using exclusions based on tags).
* **Fixed Resource Types:** Typically, a default policy is for either EBS snapshots *or* EBS-backed AMIs, and it applies to all resources of that type.
* **Extended Deletion:** For default policies, you often have the option to "extend deletion," meaning DLM will continue to delete snapshots/AMIs even if the policy is disabled or deleted, or if the targeted resource is terminated.

**Custom Policies**

* **Granular Control (Tag-Based):** Custom policies allow for much more precise control. They typically target resources based on **specific tags**. This means only volumes or instances with the tags you define in the policy will be included in the backup schedule.
* **Flexibility in Scheduling:** Custom policies offer more flexibility in defining schedules. You can often have multiple schedules within a single policy, each with different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, custom cron expressions) and retention rules (age-based or count-based).
* **Specific Use Cases:** They are ideal for scenarios where you need to manage backups for specific sets of resources, often tied to application requirements, compliance regulations, or cost optimization strategies.
* **Advanced Features:** Custom policies often support advanced features like:
    * **Application-consistent snapshots:** Using pre and post scripts to ensure data consistency for applications running on the instances/volumes.
    * **Cross-account snapshot copies:** Automating the copying of snapshots to different AWS accounts for disaster recovery or compliance.
    * **AMI deprecation:** Managing the deprecation of AMIs.
* **Explicit Resource Identification:** You must explicitly tag the resources you want the custom policy to manage. If a resource doesn't have the specified tags, it won't be affected by the policy.
* **No Automatic Extended Deletion:** If a custom policy is deleted or enters an error/disabled state, DLM typically stops managing the associated backups. You would need to manually manage their deletion.

**Analogy:**

Think of it like this:

* **Default Policy:** A universal remote control that turns off all TVs in your house at a certain time, regardless of who's watching.
* **Custom Policy:** A smart remote control that only turns off the TV in the living room if it has a specific "sleep timer" tag enabled, and can even change channels or volume based on more complex rules.

In summary, while default policies provide a simple and broad backup solution, custom policies offer the precision and flexibility needed for more complex and tailored data lifecycle management strategies.
