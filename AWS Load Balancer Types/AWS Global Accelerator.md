AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that significantly improves the availability and performance of applications for global users. It does this by leveraging the vast and highly optimized AWS global network.

Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

**How it works and improves performance:**

* **Static Anycast IP Addresses:** Global Accelerator provides you with two static Anycast IP addresses (IPv4 and optionally IPv6). These IPs serve as a fixed entry point to your application, regardless of where your actual application endpoints are located. Anycast means that the same IP address is advertised from multiple AWS edge locations worldwide. When a user connects, their traffic is automatically routed to the nearest AWS edge location that advertises that IP.
* **AWS Global Network Optimization:** Once traffic hits an AWS edge location, Global Accelerator routes it over the high-performance, congestion-free AWS global network to the nearest healthy application endpoint. This bypasses the unpredictable public internet, significantly reducing latency, jitter, and improving throughput. AWS claims it can improve connection speed and performance by as much as 60%.
* **Health Checks and Automatic Failover:** Global Accelerator continuously monitors the health of your application endpoints (e.g., Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, EC2 instances, Elastic IPs). If an endpoint becomes unhealthy, it automatically reroutes traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint within seconds, ensuring high availability and seamless user experience without any client-side changes or DNS updates.
* **Traffic Dials and Endpoint Weights:** You can control the percentage of traffic directed to specific regions or individual endpoints within an endpoint group. This is useful for blue/green deployments, A/B testing, and managing traffic distribution.
* **Client IP Preservation:** For supported endpoints, Global Accelerator can preserve the client's original IP address, which is crucial for applications that rely on IP-based security rules, personalized content, or logging.
* **DDoS Protection:** Global Accelerator is protected by AWS Shield Standard, offering built-in DDoS resiliency at the edge.

**Key Use Cases:**

* **Global Applications with Low Latency Requirements:** Ideal for applications where even milliseconds of latency matter, such as online gaming, VoIP, real-time analytics, financial trading platforms, and live streaming.
* **High Availability and Disaster Recovery:** By routing traffic across multiple AWS Regions and Availability Zones, Global Accelerator enhances application resilience and enables fast failover in case of regional outages.
* **Static IP Requirements:** Provides static IP addresses as a consistent front door to your applications, which is beneficial for customers who need to whitelist IP addresses or have fixed entry points for their services.
* **Multi-Region Deployments:** Simplifies traffic management for applications deployed across multiple AWS Regions, allowing for easy addition or removal of origins without impacting users.
* **Non-HTTP/HTTPS Traffic:** Supports TCP and UDP protocols, making it suitable for a wider range of applications beyond typical web traffic.

**Pricing:**

AWS Global Accelerator pricing is based on two main components:

1.  **Fixed Hourly Fee:** You pay a fixed hourly fee for each accelerator provisioned in your account, regardless of whether it's enabled or disabled. As of my last update, this is typically $0.025 per hour.
2.  **Data Transfer Premium (DT-Premium):** This is an incremental charge on top of standard AWS data transfer rates. It's calculated based on the amount of data transferred in the dominant direction (inbound or outbound) and varies by the source AWS region and the AWS edge location where the responses are directed.

**Global Accelerator vs. CloudFront:**

While both services use the AWS global network and its edge locations to improve performance, they serve different primary purposes:

| Feature                   | AWS Global Accelerator                                    | Amazon CloudFront                                           |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal** | Optimize network path for dynamic or static application traffic | Cache and deliver static and dynamic web content            |
| **Protocols** | TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS                                     | HTTP, HTTPS                                                 |
| **IP Addressing** | Provides static Anycast IP addresses                      | Uses dynamic IP addresses (behind the scenes)               |
| **Caching** | No caching functionality                                  | Caches content at edge locations                            |
| **Best for** | Low-latency applications, real-time data, multi-region failover, applications requiring fixed IPs | Delivering static assets (images, videos), dynamic web content, reducing origin load |
| **Use Cases** | Gaming, VoIP, IoT, financial trading, B2B applications    | Websites, streaming media, API acceleration                  |

In many cases, CloudFront and Global Accelerator can be used together to provide a comprehensive solution, with CloudFront handling static content delivery and Global Accelerator optimizing the network path for dynamic application interactions.
