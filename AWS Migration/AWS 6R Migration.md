The AWS 6 R's of migration is a framework developed by Amazon to help organizations categorize and plan their cloud migration strategy for different applications and workloads. The "6 R's" are not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a set of distinct approaches that can be applied to different parts of an IT portfolio. Choosing the right "R" for each application is a critical step in a successful and cost-effective migration.

Here's a detailed breakdown of each of the 6 R's:

### 1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)
* **What it is:** Moving an application to the cloud with minimal or no changes to its architecture. You "lift" the application from its on-premises environment and "shift" it to an AWS EC2 instance.
* **When to use it:**
    * For organizations that need to migrate quickly, often due to data center contract expiration.
    * For applications with a large number of servers that need to be moved in a short amount of time.
    * As a first step in a long-term modernization plan, as it's often easier to optimize an application once it's already in the cloud.
* **Pros:** Fast, low risk, and cost-effective in the short term. It provides immediate benefits like reduced data center costs and increased agility.
* **Cons:** Does not leverage cloud-native features and may carry over legacy inefficiencies and technical debt.

### 2. Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)
* **What it is:** Moving an application to the cloud while making a few key optimizations to take advantage of cloud capabilities. This often involves swapping out on-premises components for managed services.
* **When to use it:**
    * When you want to gain some of the benefits of the cloud without a complete re-architecture.
    * A common example is migrating an on-premises database to a managed service like Amazon RDS or a self-hosted application to a platform service like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
* **Pros:** Offers a better balance of speed and optimization than rehosting. It can reduce operational overhead (e.g., database patching and maintenance) and improve cost efficiency.
* **Cons:** Requires more effort and planning than a simple rehost and may not fully unlock all the benefits of the cloud.

### 3. Repurchase (Drop and Shop)
* **What it is:** Moving to a different, cloud-based product. This typically means abandoning a custom-built or on-premises application and replacing it with a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution.
* **When to use it:**
    * When an existing application is no longer meeting business needs, is difficult to maintain, or is not cost-effective.
    * Common examples include moving from an on-premises CRM to Salesforce, or an HR system to Workday.
* **Pros:** Can result in significant cost savings and faster time-to-market. It removes the burden of managing and maintaining the application.
* **Cons:** Involves a significant change for end-users and may require data migration and user training. It can also lead to vendor lock-in.

### 4. Refactor (or Re-architect)
* **What it is:** Re-imagining how an application is designed and developed, typically by using cloud-native features to improve agility, scalability, and performance. This is the most complex and time-consuming strategy.
* **When to use it:**
    * When there is a strong business need to add new features that are difficult to implement in the existing architecture.
    * When the current application cannot meet growing demands for scalability or performance.
    * This often involves breaking a monolithic application into microservices, using serverless technologies like AWS Lambda, or modernizing a database to Amazon Aurora.
* **Pros:** Fully leverages the power of the cloud, leading to massive improvements in agility, scalability, and long-term cost efficiency.
* **Cons:** The most expensive and labor-intensive strategy, requiring significant time, resources, and technical expertise.

### 5. Retire
* **What it is:** Decommissioning applications that are no longer needed.
* **When to use it:**
    * As part of the discovery and planning phase, you should identify applications that are no longer used or provide no business value.
    * Retiring these applications saves money on licensing, maintenance, and hosting, and allows the migration team to focus on the applications that matter.
* **Pros:** Immediate cost savings and a reduced attack surface.

### 6. Retain
* **What it is:** Deciding not to migrate certain applications to the cloud at this time and keeping them in their current on-premises environment.
* **When to use it:**
    * When an application has a recent and significant investment in on-premises infrastructure.
    * When there are compliance or regulatory reasons that prevent the data or application from moving to the cloud.
    * For applications that are not yet a business priority for migration.
* **Pros:** Avoids the cost and risk of migrating an application that is not a good candidate for the cloud. This often leads to a hybrid cloud model where some workloads remain on-premises.

By systematically applying these six strategies to your application portfolio, you can create a comprehensive and effective migration plan that aligns with your business goals and maximizes the benefits of the cloud.
