When an organization decides to move its applications and data to the AWS Cloud, it needs a strategic approach. AWS has defined a set of migration strategies, commonly known as the "7 Rs," to help businesses classify their applications and choose the most suitable path for each workload.

Here are the seven common AWS migration strategies:

1.  **Rehost (Lift and Shift):** This is the simplest migration strategy. You move your applications to AWS without making any changes to their architecture or code. This is often the fastest way to migrate and is a good option for organizations looking to move quickly to the cloud to meet business objectives. Tools like AWS Application Migration Service can automate this process.

2.  **Relocate (Hypervisor-level Lift and Shift):** This strategy is similar to rehosting but is specifically for moving virtual machines (VMs) from an on-premises hypervisor (like VMware) to a new environment in AWS. It's essentially a "lift and shift" at the virtualization layer. AWS services like AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces can help with this.

3.  **Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift):** With this strategy, you move an application to AWS and make a few small, cloud-optimized changes to achieve a tangible benefit, without fundamentally changing the core architecture. An example would be migrating an on-premises database to a managed database service like Amazon RDS to reduce the time you spend on database administration.

4.  **Repurchase (Drop and Shop):** This involves moving to a different product, typically by abandoning your old application and replacing it with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution. A common example is migrating from an on-premises CRM system to Salesforce.com or an HR system to Workday.

5.  **Refactor/Rearchitect:** This is the most complex but also the most future-proof strategy. You re-imagine how the application is architected and developed, typically by using cloud-native features and services. This is often driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or improve performance that would be difficult to achieve in the application's existing environment. For example, you might refactor a monolithic application into a microservices architecture to take advantage of services like AWS Lambda.

6.  **Retire:** When you assess your application portfolio, you'll likely find that some applications are no longer useful. By identifying and retiring these applications, you can save money on maintenance and licensing, and direct your team's attention to the applications that provide real business value.

7.  **Retain:** This strategy means you do nothing with certain applications and keep them in their current on-premises environment. This may be due to factors like legal or compliance restrictions, high migration costs, or if the application was recently upgraded and is not a priority for migration at the moment. As your organization's cloud presence grows, the reasons to retain applications on-premises may diminish over time.
