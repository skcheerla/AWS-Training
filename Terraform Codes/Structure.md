I've created a comprehensive Terraform code structure for VPC creation that's production-ready and GitHub-compatible. Here are the key features:
Structure Highlights:

Modular Design: Separate VPC module for reusability across environments
Environment Management: Dedicated folders for dev/staging/prod with separate state files
Secrets Management: Proper handling of sensitive data using GitHub Secrets and AWS IAM
CI/CD Ready: GitHub Actions workflows for automated planning and deployment
Best Practices: Includes validation, locking, encryption, and proper tagging

Key Security Features:

State Management: S3 backend with encryption and DynamoDB locking
Secrets: GitHub Secrets for AWS credentials, no hardcoded values
Access Control: Environment-specific IAM roles and policies
Gitignore: Proper exclusion of sensitive files

Production-Ready Elements:

Validation: Input validation for CIDR blocks and environments
Tags: Comprehensive tagging strategy for cost management
Documentation: Detailed README and inline comments
Scripts: Automation scripts for common operations
Flexibility: Configurable NAT gateways, subnets, and DNS settings

Getting Started:

Copy the structure to your repository
Update the S3 bucket name in backend configurations
Set up AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets
Customize the variables in terraform.tfvars.example
Run the initialization script for your environment

This structure supports multiple environments, follows Terraform best practices, and provides a solid foundation for managing VPC infrastructure at scale. The modular approach makes it easy to extend with additional AWS resources later.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
