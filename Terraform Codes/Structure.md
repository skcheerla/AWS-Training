I'll help you create a comprehensive Terraform code structure for VPC creation with proper organization, variables, and secrets management. Here's a production-ready structure:I've created a comprehensive Terraform code structure for VPC creation that's production-ready and GitHub-compatible. Here are the key features:

## **Structure Highlights:**

1. **Modular Design**: Separate VPC module for reusability across environments
2. **Environment Management**: Dedicated folders for dev/staging/prod with separate state files
3. **Secrets Management**: Proper handling of sensitive data using GitHub Secrets and AWS IAM
4. **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated planning and deployment
5. **Best Practices**: Includes validation, locking, encryption, and proper tagging

## **Key Security Features:**

- **State Management**: S3 backend with encryption and DynamoDB locking
- **Secrets**: GitHub Secrets for AWS credentials, no hardcoded values
- **Access Control**: Environment-specific IAM roles and policies
- **Gitignore**: Proper exclusion of sensitive files

## **Production-Ready Elements:**

- **Validation**: Input validation for CIDR blocks and environments
- **Tags**: Comprehensive tagging strategy for cost management
- **Documentation**: Detailed README and inline comments
- **Scripts**: Automation scripts for common operations
- **Flexibility**: Configurable NAT gateways, subnets, and DNS settings

## **Getting Started:**

1. Copy the structure to your repository
2. Update the S3 bucket name in backend configurations
3. Set up AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets
4. Customize the variables in `terraform.tfvars.example`
5. Run the initialization script for your environment

This structure supports multiple environments, follows Terraform best practices, and provides a solid foundation for managing VPC infrastructure at scale. The modular approach makes it easy to extend with additional AWS resources later.
